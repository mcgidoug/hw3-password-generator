# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

# Description:

Password generator will prompt user to input parameters specifying length and character type when they click the "generate password" button. Once button is clicked, user will be required to make their choice. If user does not specify password length between 8 and 128 characters, they will be redirected to do so with an alert. If user denies all character set choices, they will be redirected to do so. Once user chooses password length and character sets, the JavaScript will run a function to generate a random password within the empty box displayed on the page.
